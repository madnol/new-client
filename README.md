I'm building a Video chat for students

## How does it works?
This app works with simple-peer, a library that wraps within it webRTC.

webRTC or web real-time communication is a technology that exists in a most modern browser and allows users to communicate in real-time without actually using server.
It supports video, voice, and generic data to be sent between peers, allowing developers to build powerful voice- and video-communication solutions.
